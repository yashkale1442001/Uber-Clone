# Uber-Clone
This project is a full-stack application that replicates the core functionalities of the popular ride-sharing service, Uber. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this application allows users to request rides, drivers to accept requests, and provides a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.
